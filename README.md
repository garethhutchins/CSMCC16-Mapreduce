# CSMCC16-Mapreduce
A c# Project to replicate Map Reduce functionality.
This program takes two input files that have been pre-defined.

Mapping corrects any errors and saves intermediate values as key value pairs.

Sorting then occurs to make reducing easier.

Reducing then creates the final output files and saves the results
